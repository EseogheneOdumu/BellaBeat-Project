# About
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. They offer different smart devices that collect data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.

The main focus of this case is to analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how people are already using non-Bellabeat products. Based on insights gained from the analysis, recommendations should be given for how this trend and insight apply to bellabeats customers and how they can help influence marketing strategy for bellabeat.

Data used in this analysis is a Public Domain dataset from Kaggle called FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset includes 18 .cvs files with data about sleep, calories, steps, and other information tracked by FitBit. I’ve used only 4 of them in my analysis - dailyActivity_merged.cvs (it’s a file that includes daily calories, steps and intensities combined), sleepDay_merged.cvs, weightLogInfo_merged.cvs, and hourlySteps_merged.cvs.

# Tools Used
Excel – For cleaning and sorting the data

SQL Server – For querying and analyzing the data

PowerBi & Tableau – For visualizing

# Key Findings
* Data was collected from 33 participants, this is a very small sample which creates data bias. Not all users use sleep tracker and weight log. Weight log is the least popular function of FitBit.
* Users are more active between 8am and 7pm. Walking more steps during lunch time from 12pm to 2pm and evenings from 5pm and 7pm. The least active time was at night.
* Users are fairly distributed by their activity considering the daily amount of steps. We can determine that based on users activity all kind of users wear smart-devices.
* There’s no visible correlation between the number of steps and weekends/weekdays. 
* 50% of the users use their device on a daily basis
* More steps were taken by very active users which correlates with more calories being lost/used up by very active users
* Users walk daily the recommended amount of steps of 7500 besides Friday, Thursday and Sunday's.
* Users don't sleep the recommended amount of minutes/ hours - 8 hours.

# Recommendations
* Further analysis, preferably a survey, needed to check why the weight log is not popular (questions about the relevance of the function, ease of use etc.) and why the participants didn’t track their steps every day (questions about the battery life, relevance of the function, charging system, design of the device, etc.)
* Bellabeat could use push messages about the risks of high sedentary time, health benefits of 7,500 steps etc. to make users more active during the day. As CDC explains, the more steps you walk the lower the mortality rate.
* To improve sleep time, a feature (bedtime mode) can be created where users are allowed to set a prefered  bedtime and and receive notifications just before that time. It will also include helpful resources such as relaxing music etc.
* We could create a gamified system on the app where users can earn rewards based on their daily step count to increase motivation and engagement.
