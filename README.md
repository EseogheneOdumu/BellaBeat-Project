# BellaBeat-Project

# About
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. They offer different smart devices that collect data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.

The main focus of this case is to analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how people are already using non-Bellabeat products. Based on insights gained from the analysis, recommendations should be given for how this trend and insight apply to bellabeats customers and how they can help influence marketing strategy for bellabeat.

Data used in this analysis is a Public Domain dataset from Kaggle called FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset includes 18 .cvs files with data about sleep, calories, steps, and other information tracked by FitBit. I’ve used only 4 of them in my analysis - dailyActivity_merged.cvs (it’s a file that includes daily calories, steps and intensities combined), sleepDay_merged.cvs, weightLogInfo_merged.cvs, and hourlySteps_merged.cvs.
